# Professional README Generator

## Description
Every GitHub project requires a README file to explain certain details about the project that can't necessarily be gathered from just the code itself. This applications helps users ensure they provide basic information required for a README, including installation instructions, usage, licensing, how to contribute, testing, and questions. This helps solve the problem of going back to search through old README files or templates online to remember what information is supposed to be included in a project README; the application will generate questions for a user to enter all relevant README information. Once the user has answered all questions, a README file is generated with input from the user.
